**LangGraph Platform** extends the [LangGraph](/oss/python/overview) framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications as graphs, which allows you to define control flow, manage persistence, and coordinate interactions across components or agents. LangGraph Platform is framework-agnostic, which means you can deploy and operate agents built with LangGraph or [another framework](/langgraph-platform/autogen-integration).

To get acquainted with LangGraph's key concepts and features, complete the following LangGraph basics tutorials series in the [LangGraph OSS docs](/oss/python/why-langgraph):

1. [Build a basic chatbot](/oss/python/1-build-basic-chatbot)
2. [Add tools](/oss/python/2-add-tools)
3. [Add memory](/oss/python/3-add-memory)
4. [Add human-in-the-loop controls](/oss/python/4-human-in-the-loop)
5. [Customize state](/oss/python/5-customize-state)
6. [Time travel](/oss/python/6-time-travel)

While the OSS framework introduces the core abstractions and execution model, LangGraph Platform adds capabilities including managed infrastructure, [deployment models](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options), [assistants](/langgraph-platform/configuration-cloud), and [double-texting](/langgraph-platform/double-texting) support. These platform-level features support the full lifecycle of LangGraph applications, from development to production at scale.
