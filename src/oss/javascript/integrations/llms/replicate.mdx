Here's an example of calling a Replicate model as an LLM:


```bash npm
npm install replicate@1 @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import ReplicateLlama2 from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/llm/replicate_llama2.mdx";

<ReplicateLlama2 />

You can run other models through Replicate by changing the `model` parameter.

You can find a full list of models on [Replicate's website](https://replicate.com/explore).
