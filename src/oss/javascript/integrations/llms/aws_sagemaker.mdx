LangChain.js supports integration with AWS SageMaker-hosted endpoints. Check [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/) for a list of available models, and how to deploy your own.

## Setup

You'll need to install the official SageMaker SDK as a peer dependency:

```bash npm
npm install @aws-sdk/client-sagemaker-runtime
```
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import SagemakerEndpoint from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/llm/sagemaker_endpoint.mdx";

<SagemakerEndpoint />
