LangChain supports chat models hosted by [Deep Infra](https://deepinfra.com/) through the `ChatDeepInfra` wrapper.
First, you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` package:


```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll need to obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable named `DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`
(or pass it into the constructor), then call the model as shown below:

import IntegrationDeepinfra from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/chat/integration_deepinfra.mdx";

<IntegrationDeepinfra />
