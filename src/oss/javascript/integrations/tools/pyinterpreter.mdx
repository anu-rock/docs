<Warning>
This tool executes code and can potentially perform destructive actions. Be careful that you trust any code passed to it!
</Warning>

LangChain offers an experimental tool for executing arbitrary Python code.
This can be useful in combination with an LLM that can generate code to perform more powerful computations.

## Usage

import Pyinterpreter from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/tools/pyinterpreter.mdx";


```bash npm
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<Pyinterpreter />
