LangGraph follows a structured release policy to ensure stability and predictability for users building production applications.

## Versioning

### Core Package

LangGraph follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in the format of **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**.

Major version increases will occur for:
- Breaking changes to any public interfaces
- Removal of deprecated features
- Significant architectural changes

Minor version increases will occur for:
- New features and capabilities
- Performance improvements
- New optional parameters
- Backward-compatible enhancements

Patch version increases will occur for:
- Bug fixes
- Security updates
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations without API changes

### Pre-built Components

The `langgraph.prebuilt` module follows the same versioning as the core package, ensuring compatibility between core and pre-built components.

## Release Cadence

We expect to space out **major** releases by at least 6-12 months to provide stability for production applications.

**Minor** releases are typically released every 1-2 months with new features and improvements.

**Patch** releases are released as needed, often weekly, to address bugs and security issues.

## API Stability

### Stable APIs

All APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for stable features within a major version.

### Beta Features

Features marked as `beta` in the documentation are:
- Feature-complete and tested
- Safe for production use with the understanding they may change
- Subject to minor API adjustments based on user feedback

### Experimental Features

Features marked as `experimental` or `alpha`:
- Are under active development
- May change significantly or be removed
- Should be used with caution in production

### Internal APIs

APIs prefixed with underscore (`_`) or explicitly marked as internal:
- Are not part of the public API
- May change without notice
- Should not be used directly

## Deprecation Policy

When deprecating features:

1. **Deprecation Notice**: Features are marked as deprecated with clear migration guidance
2. **Grace Period**: Deprecated features remain functional for at least one minor version
3. **Removal**: Features are removed only in major version releases
4. **Migration Support**: We provide migration guides and, when possible, automated tools

## Platform Compatibility

### Python Support

- We support Python versions that are actively maintained by the Python Software Foundation
- Python version requirements may change only in major releases
- Currently requires Python 3.10 or later

### JavaScript/TypeScript Support

- We support Node.js LTS versions
- TypeScript definitions are provided for all public APIs
- Browser compatibility is documented for client-side components

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are only introduced in major versions and include:
- Removal of deprecated APIs
- Changes to required parameters
- Changes to default behavior that affect existing applications
- Minimum Python/Node.js version updates

## Migration Support

For major version upgrades, we provide:
- Comprehensive migration guides
- Automated migration scripts when feasible
- Extended support period for the previous major version
- Clear documentation of all breaking changes

## Long-term Support (LTS)

Selected versions may be designated as LTS releases:
- Receive security updates and critical bug fixes for extended periods
- Ideal for enterprise deployments requiring maximum stability
- LTS status is announced at release time
