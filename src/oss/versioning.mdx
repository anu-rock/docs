title: Versioning
---

Each version number follows the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **Major**: Breaking API updates that require code changes.
- **Minor**: New features and improvements that maintain backward compatibility.
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements.

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles:

- **1.0.0**: First stable release with production-ready APIs
- **1.1.0**: New features added in a backward-compatible manner
- **1.0.1**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

## API Stability

We communicate the stability of our APIs as follows:

### Stable APIs

All APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for stable features and only introduce breaking changes in major releases.

### Beta APIs

APIs marked as `beta` are feature-complete but may undergo minor changes based on user feedback. They are safe for production use but may require small adjustments in future releases.

### Alpha APIs

APIs marked as `alpha` are experimental and subject to significant changes. Use these with caution in production environments.

### Deprecated APIs

APIs marked as `deprecated` will be removed in future major releases. When possible, we specify the intended version of removal. To handle deprecations:

1. Switch to the recommended alternative API
2. Follow the migration guide (released alongside major releases)
3. Use the LangChain CLI tool to automatically update deprecated imports (TODO: is this still usable?)

## Release Cycles

### Major Releases

Major releases (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0) may include:
- Breaking API changes
- Removal of deprecated features
- Significant architectural improvements

We provide:
- Detailed migration guides
- Automated migration tools when possible
- Extended support period for the previous major version

### Minor Releases

Minor releases (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0) include:
- New features and capabilities
- Performance improvements
- New optional parameters
- Backward-compatible enhancements

### Patch Releases

Patch releases (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1) include:
- Bug fixes
- Security updates
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations without API changes

## Version Support Policy

- **Latest Major Version**: Full support with active development
- **Previous Major Version**: Security updates and critical bug fixes for 12 months after the next major release
- **Older Versions**: Community support only

## Checking Your Version

To check your installed version:

:::python
```python
import langchain_core
print(langchain_core.__version__)
```
:::

:::js
```javascript
import { version } from "langchain/version";
console.log(version);
```
:::

## Upgrading

:::python
```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
pip install --upgrade langchain-core langchain

# Upgrade to a specific version
pip install langchain-core==1.0.0
```
:::

:::js
```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
npm update langchain @langchain/core

# Install a specific version
npm install langchain@1.0.0 @langchain/core@1.0.0
```
:::

## Pre-release Versions

We occasionally release alpha and beta versions for early testing:

- **Alpha** (e.g., 1.0.0a1): Early preview, significant changes expected
- **Beta** (e.g., 1.0.0b1): Feature-complete, minor changes possible
- **Release Candidate** (e.g., 1.0.0rc1): Final testing before stable release

To install pre-release versions:

:::python
```bash
pip install --pre langchain-core
```
:::

:::js
```bash
npm install langchain@next
```
