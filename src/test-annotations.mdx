# Test Code Annotations

This page tests the MkDocs-style code annotations functionality with circular icons similar to MkDocs Material.

The annotations appear as circular blue icons with numbers inside. Hover over any numbered annotation in the code blocks below to see the explanatory tooltips.

## Python Example

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:  # (1)!
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",  # (2)!
    tools=[get_weather],  # (3)!
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"  # (4)!
)

# Run the agent
result = agent.invoke({  # (5)!
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]
})
```

1. Define a tool for the agent to use. Tools can be defined as vanilla Python functions.
2. Provide a language model for the agent to use. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is a powerful model for reasoning.
3. Provide a list of tools for the model to use. Multiple tools can be provided.
4. Provide a system prompt (instructions) to the language model used by the agent.
5. Invoke the agent with a user message to get a response.

## JavaScript Example

```javascript
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const agent = createReactAgent({
    llm: new ChatAnthropic({  // (1)!
        model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
    }),
    tools: [weatherTool],  // (2)!
    stateModifier: "You are helpful"  // (3)!
});
```

1. Configure the language model with specific parameters and API keys.
2. Pass an array of tools that the agent can use to fulfill requests.
3. Set the system prompt that guides the agent's behavior and responses.

## Mixed Comment Styles

```bash
pip install langgraph  # (1)!
npm install @langchain/langgraph  // (2)!
/* Install dependencies (3)! */
echo "Setup complete"  # (4)!
```

1. Install the Python version of LangGraph using pip package manager.
2. Install the JavaScript version using npm for Node.js projects.
3. This step installs all the necessary dependencies for the project.
4. Confirm that the installation process has completed successfully.
