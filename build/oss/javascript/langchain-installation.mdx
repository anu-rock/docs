LangChain provides integrations to hundreds of LLMs and thousands of other integrations.

To avoid package bloat, these live in independent provider packages. In order to
install the package for the provider you would like to work with, see the [integrations page]([other integrations](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers)).

Common packages:



<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
# installing the OpenAI integration
npm install @langchain/openai
# installing the Anthropic integration
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

```bash pnpm
# installing the OpenAI integration
pnpm add @langchain/openai
# installing the Anthropic integration
pnpm add @langchain/anthropic
```

```bash yarn
# installing the OpenAI integration
yarn add @langchain/openai
# installing the Anthropic integration
yarn add @langchain/anthropic
```

```bash bun
# installing the OpenAI integration
bun add @langchain/openai
