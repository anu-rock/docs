To install the core LangChain package

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install --pre -U langchain
```

```bash uv
uv add langchain@pre
```
</CodeGroup>




LangChain provides integrations to hundreds of LLMs and thousands of other integrations.

To avoid package bloat, these live in independent provider packages. In order to
install the package for the provider you would like to work with, see the [integrations page]([other integrations](/oss/python/integrations/providers)).

Common packages:

```bash
# installing the OpenAI integration
pip install -U langchain-openai
```




See the [integrations page](/oss/python/js-integrations) for a full list of available integrations.
